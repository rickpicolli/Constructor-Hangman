## Constructor-Hangman

### Introduction

* I created a constructor Hangman game.
* It must be ran in the Terminal/Git.
* To make this game work, you need to type in ```node index.js``` to get the first random word and start guessing the letters.

* Example for the main page of the Game

```
node index.js
```

* These are the npm packages I used and are needed to run the app
	1. [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
	2. [random-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-words)

* to install these npm packages run these commands one at a time.
```
npm install inquirer
npm install random-words
```
